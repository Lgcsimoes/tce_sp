# Public spending data analysis - Municipalities in São Paulo state, Brazil

This is a live project of the data mining and analysis of public expenditure data from all municipalities in São Paulo state, Brazil, excluding the state capital (São Paulo city). This information is publicly available at the Data Transparency website of [São Paulo state Accounting Office (*Tribunal de Contas do Estado de São Paulo*)](http://transparencia.tce.sp.gov.br/).

Auxiliary information regarding characteristics from each municipality will be obtained from [IBGE website]() (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, *Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística*).

The analysis will be done in multiple steps, using several Python notebooks to focus on one analysis at a time.
